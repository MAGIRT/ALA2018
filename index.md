# Understanding and Using Spatial Humanities: Digital Mapping at the Forefront of Scholarly Research

### Saturday, June 23, 2018 --- 8:30-10:00 am, Morial Convention Center, Rm 281-282

Academic librarians are increasingly required to understand and experience in the digital scholarship that supports any scholarly activities conducted in using digital technology. GIS and spatial humanities are part of the digital scholarship that provides dynamic visual impact to the rapidly growing area of digital scholarship.  In meeting the needs of this growing field, librarians need to develop the skills and knowledge to assist researchers in creating successful and insightful projects.  

During this session, panel experts will focus on overview of spatial humanities in digital scholarship, the skills and innovations available to librarian to successfully guide researchers in spatial humanities, and challenges that may emerge in spatial humanity practices for various research projects. 

Panelists include Katherine Hart Weimer (Rice University), Nicole Kong (Purdue University) and Chelcie Rowell (Boston College).  Leslie Wagner, Chair of MAGIRT, will act as moderator.
